## Homeworld Cataclysm Gameplay Features
 
Homeworld Cataclysm is not just a simple expansion to Homeworld, but a standalone game that introduces many new features and improvements to the gameplay. Here are some of the main aspects that make Homeworld Cataclysm a unique and enjoyable real-time strategy game:

The Kuun-Lan can also dock with other ships and stations, allowing the player to salvage resources, repair damage, or capture enemy vessels. The Kuun-Lan is also equipped with a powerful weapon called the Siege Cannon, which can fire a devastating blast at long range.
- The Somtaaw: The player's faction is the Somtaaw, a mining clan that belongs to the Hiigaran race. The Somtaaw have a different set of ships and technologies than the original Homeworld factions, such as the Mimic, which can disguise itself as any ship; the Acolyte, which can link with other Acolytes to form larger ships; or the Sentinel, which can create a defensive shield around itself and nearby allies.
- The Campaign: The single-player campaign consists of 17 missions that follow the story of the Somtaaw's encounter with the Beast and their struggle to survive and stop it. The campaign features diverse objectives and scenarios, such as escorting convoys, defending bases, infiltrating enemy territory, or assaulting massive fortresses. The campaign also has branching paths and multiple endings depending on the player's choices and actions.
- The Multiplayer: The multiplayer mode supports up to eight players in various modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, or cooperative. The multiplayer mode also features a map editor that allows players to create their own custom maps and scenarios. The multiplayer mode is compatible with both Homeworld Cataclysm and Homeworld 1 players, as long as they have the same version of the game.

Homeworld Cataclysm is a game that offers a rich and immersive gameplay experience that will appeal to both fans of Homeworld and newcomers alike.
