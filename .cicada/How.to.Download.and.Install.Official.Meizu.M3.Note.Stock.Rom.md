Once your phone is connected, open My Computer or This PC on your computer and look for your phone's icon. It should be labeled as Meizu M3 Note or something similar. Double-click on it and open the internal storage or SD card folder of your phone. You will see various folders such as DCIM, Music, Pictures, etc.
 
Now, go back to the folder where you extracted the zip file in step 2 and look for a file named update.zip or something similar. This is the firmware file that you need to copy to your phone's SD card. Right-click on it and select Copy. Then go back to your phone's folder and right-click on an empty space and select Paste.
